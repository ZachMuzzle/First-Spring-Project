# First Spring Boot Project

## What This Project Does

The project is a simple Spring Boot project to get familiar with Spring Boot. I will be adding  more complex
ones in the future.

When ran using *Intellij* a local  host will be created. Once visting  that local host site. The output from
[greetingController](src/main/java/com/example/Demo/tutorial/controller/greetingController.java) will display
**This is the first Spring Boot App** on a webpage.
